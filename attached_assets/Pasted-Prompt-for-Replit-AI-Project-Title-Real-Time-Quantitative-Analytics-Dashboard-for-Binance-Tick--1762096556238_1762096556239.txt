Prompt for Replit AI

Project Title:
📊 Real-Time Quantitative Analytics Dashboard for Binance Tick Data

Description / Prompt:
Build a Python-based full-stack analytical dashboard that demonstrates real-time data ingestion, storage, quantitative analytics, and interactive visualization for financial tick data.

The app should use Plotly Dash or Streamlit (developer’s choice) for the frontend, and Python-based analytics on the backend.

🔗 Data Input Sources

The user must be able to select one of the following data sources:

Browser stream URL: A WebSocket/HTTP URL (e.g., from Binance or HTML collector in browser format).

Local server stream: Running WebSocket on localhost.

Uploaded NDJSON file: The user can upload previously collected tick data (from files like ticks_*.ndjson).

The system should automatically detect the type and begin data ingestion accordingly.

⚙️ Core Functionalities

Parse real-time or uploaded tick data {symbol, timestamp, price, size}.

Resample the tick data into selectable timeframes: 1s, 1m, 5m.

Store the resampled data in an in-memory database (Pandas, SQLite, or Redis).

Compute the following analytics in real time:

Price statistics (mean, std, min, max)

Hedge ratio (via OLS regression)

Spread, rolling mean, rolling std

Z-score

Rolling correlation between symbols

ADF test p-values (stationarity check)

VWAP (volume-weighted average price)

📈 Visualizations Required

The app should create the following graphs and dashboards, and is free to decide which page or section to place each chart in (e.g., Home, Analytics, Correlations, Alerts):

Live Price Chart: Line chart of price vs timestamp (auto-updating).

Volume Chart: Bar or area chart of trade size over time.

Spread Chart: Spread vs time with mean and ±2σ bands.

Z-Score Chart: Z-score vs time with highlighted threshold regions (e.g., >2 or <-2).

Hedge Ratio Regression Plot: Scatter plot (price₂ vs price₁) with regression line.

Rolling Correlation Chart: Line plot showing correlation over time.

ADF Test Visualization: p-value bar or line chart to indicate stationarity.

Correlation Heatmap: Heatmap showing pairwise correlation between all symbols.

VWAP vs Price Comparison: Overlay line plot comparing VWAP and price.

Mean-Reversion Backtest Curve: Line plot showing hypothetical PnL or equity curve from simple z-score strategy.

Alerts Overview: Markers on spread/z-score charts where user-defined alert triggers occurred.

Multi-Symbol Summary Table: Table with latest price, volume, rolling correlation, and ADF status, with CSV download option.

🧩 UI & Interactivity Requirements

Symbol selection dropdown (multi-select)

Rolling window size input

Timeframe selector (1s, 1m, 5m)

Alert rule input (z-score > threshold)

Start / Stop streaming buttons

File upload button (for NDJSON input)

CSV export button for processed data

🧱 Backend Requirements

Clean modular structure: data_ingestion, analytics, storage, visualization.

Compute analytics using Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn.

Ensure live updates for tick-based plots (every ~500ms).

Proper logging for data flow and analytics updates.

All analytics should work for both streaming and uploaded data.

🌐 Frontend / Page Guidelines

Replit AI can automatically decide how to arrange these components, but it must include:

Dashboard/Home Page: Live price, volume, and symbol controls.

Analytics Page: Spread, z-score, hedge regression, correlation, ADF results.

Correlation Page: Heatmap, rolling correlation trends.

Alerts Page: Triggered alerts list + annotated charts.

Data Page: Upload, download, and raw table views.

🧠 Technical Notes

Must run locally with python app.py.

Prefer Plotly Dash or Streamlit for interactivity.

Responsive design with zoom/pan support.

Backend computations should automatically update plots when new data arrives.

All formulas and rolling windows should be parameterized.

🧰 Bonus (Optional Enhancements)

Implement Kalman Filter for dynamic hedge ratio.

Include robust regression (Huber/Theil–Sen).

Show live z-score-based mean reversion backtest summary.

Add mini performance summary (e.g., avg spread, correlation, z-score alerts count).
